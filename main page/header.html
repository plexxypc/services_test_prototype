              Answer: Yes, the microservice architecture used to create this poker enables the independent modification of each gaming service. The game logic micro-service makes it simple to add new games, and the UI/UX micro-service makes it easier to customize the front-end style. To sum up, you can change or modify any part of the game, including the front-end and back-end. You can either assemble your team internally or hire developers from Creatiosoft Poker to modify.

              Answer: Yes, Creatiosoft Poker provides a complete solution for running an online poker network. Agents and sub-agents may manage their players with support for cashouts and deposits using a specialized agent login dashboard. With specified rake sharing, the administrator may designate affiliates and provide a unique URL for players to accept invitations. Reseller users can replenish their players' chips directly from their dashboards. From the super admin dashboard, commission schemes may be set up for several roles, including affiliates, chip resellers, agents, and sub-agents.

              <h4>How is the poker software's random number generator (RNG) controlled?</h4>
              <button type="button" class="question-btn">
                <span class="plus-icon">
                  <i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i>

            <p class="question-answer">
              Answer: The Fisher-Yates method, also known as the Knuth Shuffle, is used in many public domain PRNGs to control the RNG (Random Number Generator) in Creatiosoft Poker. This method is used to shuffle the deck of cards and ensure that the card order is random and unpredictable to provide a fair and unbiased game. This poker program is powered by a JavaScript library that is based on Python\'s "random" PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generator) module. The library uses a seed value to initialize the generator and generate random numbers. By using the same seed value, the same set of random numbers can be generated each time, which is important for maintaining fairness and reproducing game outcomes. The WELL-1024a PRNG technique is used by many poker software systems as their central random number generator (RNG). This method is known for its unpredictability and randomness and is considered to be cryptographically secure. This technique generates random numbers based on a large pool of internal states that changes after each random number generation. This ensures that every number generated is completely random and unbiased and that an external observer cannot predict the order in which the numbers are generated. Finally, it is important to note that RNG certification for software will come from reputable RNG certification laboratories such as BMM Test Labs, iTech laboratories, GLI (Gaming Laboratories International), eCOGRA (eCommerce Online Gaming Regulation and Assurance), and iTech Labs.

          faq_question: "How is the poker software's random number generator (RNG) controlled?",
          faq_answer: 'The Fisher-Yates method, also known as the Knuth Shuffle, is used in many public domain PRNGs to control the RNG (Random Number Generator) in Creatiosoft Poker. This method is used to shuffle the deck of cards and ensure that the card order is random and unpredictable to provide a fair and unbiased game. This poker program is powered by a JavaScript library that is based on Python\'s "random" PRNG (Pseudo-Random Number Generator) module. The library uses a seed value to initialize the generator and generate random numbers. By using the same seed value, the same set of random numbers can be generated each time, which is important for maintaining fairness and reproducing game outcomes. The WELL-1024a PRNG technique is used by many poker software systems as their central random number generator (RNG). This method is known for its unpredictability and randomness and is considered to be cryptographically secure. This technique generates random numbers based on a large pool of internal states that changes after each random number generation. This ensures that every number generated is completely random and unbiased and that an external observer cannot predict the order in which the numbers are generated. Finally, it is important to note that RNG certification for software will come from reputable RNG certification laboratories such as BMM Test Labs, iTech laboratories, GLI (Gaming Laboratories International), eCOGRA (eCommerce Online Gaming Regulation and Assurance), and iTech Labs.',

          faq_question: 'How much is the average cost of poker software?',
          faq_answer: "Approximately USD 10500 is spent on poker software that includes Texas and Omaha games along with standard features like player management, rake setup, game manager, deposit and cashout options, etc. But if you add more sophisticated features like agents, affiliates, tournaments, and support for many platforms including iOS, Android, Facebook, Mac, and desktop installable solutions—as well as bonuses—the price might go up to USD 60000. The necessary platform connections and technologies also affect the total cost. With a starting fee of just 2% per month on the total earned rake on our software, a white-label poker setup might be less expensive than an outright purchase. This gives you less flexibility and control than an outright purchase, but it still allows you to utilize Creatiosoft's infrastructure, branding, and software as your own. The sales staff at Creatiosoft Poker is always ready to talk about your unique needs for poker software and to deliver you a customized solution that works with your budget and meets your company objectives.
